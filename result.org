This is the input and outputfile for *ffbench*. The program only
validates the /FFBENCH/ level and inner levels to that tree, so you
are free to write in other sections.
The FFBENCH level must have this structure:
- FFBENCH (the title of the root level to the program)
  + Source
  + Transcoding Parameters
  + Destination
  + Scores
Every level has certain properties that constitute the program
settings. They are validated at startup: the program halts in case of
errors during the validation steps.
Every property of a level three or greater will be merged with the
properties of the previous level.

When a section is validated and produces some output from the program,
the output will be written as a table in a level 3 titled /Result/.

When the program is resumed, it will validate each result table
against the properties of the level. It will resume to do work against
the section that has different properties from the result table or in
which the result table is absent.

To recap:
- this file serves as input and output to ffbench
- it has a rigid structure: dump an example file using the switch
  --example
- org-properties are used to configure the behaviour of the program
- properties in sublevels will be merged: beware of name clashes
- the result of the computation of each level will be written as a
  table in /Result/ sublevel
- the program will do its best to avoid repeating previous work

* FFBENCH
** Source
:PROPERTIES:
:nsamples: 3
:duration: 5
:originalfile: big.mkv
:sourcefile: source.mkv
:END:
The program takes the original file big.mkv and divides it into
/nsamples/ long /duration/ each. Those samples are concatenated into
/sourcefile/. If possible it will try to skip the beginning and the
ending of the file, while in the case that the original file is too
short, it will copy it to /sourcefile/ unchanged.
** Transcoding Parameters 
:PROPERTIES:
:scale: original
:rencodewithsrc: yes
:END:
The program will transcode the /sourcefile/ into different output
files.

The scale property can have one of the following values: 1080, 720,
original (leave as it is). The rencodewithsrc parameters allows to
transcode the source file with the original transcoding setting. This
parameter is ignored when scale=original.

This example file uses sublevels to group trancoding parameters into
categories.
*** Default HEVC
:PROPERTIES:
:gh:    -crf 15 -codec:v libx265 -preset slow
:gm:    -crf 18 -codec:v libx265 -preset slow
:gl:    -crf 21 -codec:v libx265 -preset slow
:END:
Default hevc transcoding settings.
*** Grainy Movie Presets
:PROPERTIES:
:mh:    -crf 15 -codec:v libx265 -tune grain -preset slow
:mm:    -crf 18 -codec:v libx265 -tune grain -preset slow
:ml:    -crf 21 -codec:v libx265 -tune grain -preset slow
:END:
Uses --tune. This should be used for material that is already grainy.
Here, the grain won't be filtered out as much.
*** Cartoon Presets
:PROPERTIES:
:ch:    -crf 15 -codec:v libx265 -tune animation -preset slow
:cm:    -crf 18 -codec:v libx265 -tune animation -preset slow
:cl:    -crf 21 -codec:v libx265 -tune animation -preset slow
:END:
Uses --tune. Intended for cartoons, where deblocking is boosted to
compensate for larger, flat areas. More reference frames are used.
*** Anime Presets
:PROPERTIES:

:ml_a:    -crf=18 -x265-params "no-sao:bframes=8:psy-rd=1.5:psy-rdoq=4:aq-mode=3:ref=6" -preset slow
:END:
- gh: general purpose preset that should be good in many situations
- gm: same but medium quality
- gl: same but lower quality
- fh: preset for flat and well lit anime like slice of life genre
- fl: same but lower quality
- dh: use this in anime with many dark scenes, battle scene and good
  motion and special effects
- dm: same but lower quality
- dl: similar to the previous one but for anime with less complex
  motion and lower fx
- mh: movie-tier anime with many dark scenes, complex and grainy details
- ml: same but lower quality
